For a basic image viewer we need

* data object description (immutable after creation) : CREATE | READ | DELETE
 - ID (uint64) : GENERATED
 - URI (string) - needs to uniquely identify the dataset : REQUIRED for create
 - width, height in pixels (int, int) : OPTIONAL - can be 'created' after object creation - but once created is not updateable

* display object descirption  : READ | UPDATE | DELETE # CLONE | MERGE
 # later - modelview matrix (4x4 float array)
 - (normalized) xpos, ypos, zpos (float)
 - (normalized) xscale, yscale, zscale (float)


Creation message

client_id:object_type:uri -> object_id:uri/FAIL

OPTIONAL metadata calls:
object_id:attrib:value -> OK/FAIL

(for now)

display object message
UPDATE -> object_id:attrib:type:value -> OK/FAIL/ATTRIB_CHANGED + new_values (in future object_id)

----
Joining/creating etc

list_sessions -> list of sessions
join_session(session_name) - active, saved, or new session
	-> reply with current contents of the session # json/bson
